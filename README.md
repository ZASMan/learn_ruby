I did this as an exercise I found on the Odin Project and had a blast.
Check out my solutions and feel free to give me some tips.
Wish I would have found this when I first started learning to code!

Test First Ruby -- RSpec 3 Edition
==========
This is modified version of test-first.org's learn ruby project. See [testfirst.org/learn_ruby](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby#install) for more information about how this will work.  These test-first Ruby challenges have been forked from [https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby](https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby) and updated to use RSpec 3 instead of RSpec 2.
